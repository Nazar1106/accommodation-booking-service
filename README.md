Accommodation Booking System is a backend application built with Java and Spring Boot that simplifies the rental
process for property bookings. It allows users to reserve accommodations, enables managers to manage listings and availability,
and integrates with Stripe for secure payments and Telegram for real-time notifications. Designed to replace outdated manual workflows,
the system offers a modern, scalable, and reliable solution for real-world rental management.

## Project Structure
The project follows a standard Spring Boot layered architecture, organized into controllers, services, and repositories
to promote clean separation of concerns. All application source code is located in the src/main directory, while test
cases and integration tests reside in src/test.

## Controllers Overview
- **AccommodationController**  
  Handles management of accommodation listings. Allows administrators to create, update, delete, and retrieve accommodations, while unauthenticated users can browse available options.
- **AuthenticationController**  
  Provides user registration and login endpoints. Issues JWT tokens upon successful authentication for secure access to protected resources.
- **BookingController**  
  Manages booking lifecycle including creation, retrieval, updating, and cancellation. Supports role-based access for customers and administrators.
- **PaymentController**  
  Integrates Stripe payment processing. Handles payment initiation, success/cancel callbacks, and retrieval of payment records per user or system-wide.
- **TelegramController**  
  Generates personalized invitation links for Telegram bot integration. Enables customers to receive real-time notifications through Telegram.
- **UserController**  
  Supports profile retrieval, profile updates, password changes, and role management. Includes endpoints for both self-service and admin-level user management.
